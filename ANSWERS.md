# Architecture

## One paragraph-ish:

### Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:
Modern CPUS have multiple cores, and many can run virtual cores to double the processing power. These processors can run concurrent threads of computation, making the computer that much faster. This can present challenges when threads need to access the same resources or communicate amongst themselves.

### Describe assembly language and machine language:
Machine language is made up of the most basic instructions that you can give to a computer. Assembly language is one level of abstraction above machine language, and commands in assembly typically map closely to commands in machine code.

### Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
Compared to CPUs, GPUs have a larger number of simpler cores optimized for parallel processing of computations. This helps them to perform 5-10x better compared to a CPU of similar power when working on machine learning tasks.
